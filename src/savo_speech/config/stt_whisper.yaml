# ============================================================================
# Robot Savo — STT configuration for faster-whisper (ReSpeaker + utterance mode)
#
# This config is used by the savo_speech/stt_node.
#
# Usage on the Pi (after build + env.sh):
#
#   cd ~/Savo_Pi
#   source tools/scripts/env.sh
#
#   ros2 run savo_speech stt_node \
#     --ros-args \
#       --log-level INFO \
#       --params-file $(ros2 pkg prefix savo_speech)/share/savo_speech/config/stt_whisper.yaml
#
# You can still override individual params from CLI, for example:
#
#   -p model_size_or_path:="base.en"
#   -p block_duration_s:=3.0

    # Faster-Whisper model configuration
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Model choices (for Pi 5, CPU, int8):
    #   - "tiny.en"  : fastest, lowest quality (we tested: not good enough)
    #   - "base.en"  : middle ground (OK option if small.en too heavy)
    #   - "small.en" : best quality that is still realistic on Pi
    #
    # This config assumes you already downloaded "small.en" once.
    model_size_or_path: "small.en"

    # Device:
    #   - "cpu" on the Pi
    device: "cpu"

    # Compute type:
    #   - "int8" is the right trade-off on ARM CPU (smaller, faster)
    compute_type: "int8"

    # Language:
    #   - "en" because Robot Savo speaks and listens in English in v1.
    language: "en"

    # Beam search:
    #   - 3 is a good balance. You can go to 1 for a bit more speed, or 5 for
    #     a tiny quality boost if CPU allows.
    beam_size: 3

    # Audio capture + simple VAD
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Input sample rate for STT:
    #   - 16000 Hz is standard for Whisper models.
    sample_rate: 16000

    # Length of each raw audio block captured from ReSpeaker (seconds).
    # In "utterance_mode" this is NOT the final sentence length; blocks are
    # buffered until the user stops talking, then concatenated and sent once
    # to Whisper.
    #
    #   - 3.0–4.0 s is a good trade-off on Pi:
    #       * not too much latency
    #       * enough context per chunk for stable VAD
    block_duration_s: 4.0

    # Energy threshold for simple block-level VAD:
    #   - We saw idle noise ≈ 0.00016 in your hallway tests.
    #   - 0.0003 is slightly above noise but still very forgiving, so speech
    #     is not missed even if you speak softly or further from ReSpeaker.
    #
    # You can tighten this later if you see too many false triggers.
    energy_threshold: 0.0003

    # Minimum transcript length:
    #   - Ignore extremely short outputs (noise, breath, partial syllables).
    #   - Allow short commands like "stop", "status", "hello".
    min_transcript_chars: 3

    # Force input device to ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array:
    #   - From sd.query_devices() on your Pi:
    #       0 ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array (UAC1.0): USB Audio (hw:0,0)
    #   - So we fix input_device_index to 0.
    #
    # If you ever change audio hardware, update this index.
    input_device_index: 0

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Utterance-level behavior
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # utterance_mode:
    #   - True  → buffer multiple blocks while speech is present.
    #             When a silent block arrives, treat it as end-of-utterance,
    #             concatenate all buffered blocks, run Whisper once, and
    #             publish ONE final transcript to /savo_intent/user_text.
    #
    #   - False → legacy per-block mode (every voiced block is sent directly
    #             to Whisper, which leads to partial sentences).
    utterance_mode: true

    # Safety limit for a single utterance duration (seconds):
    #   - Prevents buffering forever if someone talks non-stop.
    #   - If exceeded, the node forces an utterance finalize and starts a
    #     new one.
    max_utterance_duration_s: 15.0
